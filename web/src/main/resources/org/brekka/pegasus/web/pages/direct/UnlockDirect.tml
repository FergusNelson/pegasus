    <p> Welcome to send.is file delivery. You have been directed to this page because someone
        wants to send you one or more files, but also make sure that you and only you can download them. </p>
        
    <p> The sender should have provided you with an "Unlock code", either by telling it to you
        over the phone, or sending it to you via SMS. Please enter that eight digit code into the
        "Code" field below and then click "Unlock". </p>
