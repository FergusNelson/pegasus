    <div id="introduction">
        <p> A service that allows files to be transferred securely, without any additional software other than 
        a normal web browser. Files can be transferred between individuals and/or systems. Depending on the 
        mechanism used, transfers are protected either by one-time codes or the public encryption keys of members. 
        Files are time limited and removed either within a configured time or when the file has been received
        by the third party. </p>
        
        <p> Please note that file uploads are currently limited to 5MB for direct transfers, 50MB for members. 
            Access is also currently limited to specific IP ranges. </p>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Send files direct without signing up</em> 
                <p>The system will provide a URL that can be e-mailed, along with
                a code that should be relayed via another medium such as SMS or phone conversation.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><em>Membership</em> 
                <p> Use your Open ID account (such as Google, Yahoo) to become a member and open up the
                    full capability of send.is. A strong master password will be required to protect your
                    transfers and personal details. Features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Create 'inboxes' that allow others to easily send you files without having to sign up themselves. All they
                        need is a URL such as "https://send.is/MyInbox". </li>
                        <li> Keep track of what files you have sent and know when they were downloaded. </li>
                        <li> Cancel a file transfer if you change your mind (prior to the third party retrieving it).  </li>
                        <li> Transfers between members require no additional codes. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><em>Organizations</em>
                    <p> Send and receive files securely as an organization. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Branding applied throughout. </li>
                        <li> Sent/received files accessible by designated associates (members of the organization). </li>
                        <li> API for allocating and receiving files. </li>
